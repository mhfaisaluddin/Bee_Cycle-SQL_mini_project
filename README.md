# Bee Cycle - SQL_mini_project

Bee Cycle is a cycle stuff retailer, which sells bikes, accessories, clothing, and components. Through this project, we will **create tables**, **import the data**, and **explore the data** by creating some queries.

***Actionable Insights:***
- Communicate to the marketing team to create a discount coupon for bike products to get market interest & increase the revenue in any branch, due to the past revenue data in Australia.
- Discuss the previous customer behavior to get the most valuable user to apply the discount in each branch.
- Discuss with the marketing team to create a perfect bundle product that suits market and campaign needs.
